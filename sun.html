<p>The <b>Sun</b> is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive, nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy from its surface mainly as visible light and infrared radiation with 10% at ultraviolet energies. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. The Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures. It has been a central subject for astronomical research since antiquity.
</p><p>The Sun orbits the Galactic Center at a distance of 24,000 to 28,000 light-years. From Earth, it is <span class="nowrap"><span data-sort-value="7000100000000000000♠"></span>1 astronomical unit</span> (<span class="nowrap"><span data-sort-value="7011149600000000000♠"></span>1.496<span style="margin-left:0.25em;margin-right:0.15em;">×</span>10<sup>8</sup> km</span>) or about 8 light-minutes away. Its diameter is about <span class="nowrap"><span data-sort-value="7009139140000000000♠"></span>1,391,400 km</span> (<span class="nowrap"><span data-sort-value="7009139143882240000♠"></span>864,600 mi</span>), 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, making up about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.
</p><p>The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V), informally called a yellow dwarf, though its light is actually white. It formed approximately 4.6 billion<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-short_17-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>a<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. Every second, the Sun's core fuses about 600 billion kilograms (kg) of hydrogen into helium and converts 4 billion kg of matter into energy.
</p><p>About 4 to 7 billion years from now, when hydrogen fusion in the Sun's core diminishes to the point where the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature which will cause its outer layers to expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. This process will make the Sun large enough to render Earth uninhabitable approximately five billion years from the present. After the red giant phase, models suggest the Sun will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star (a white dwarf), and no longer produce energy by fusion, but will still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion for perhaps trillions of years. After that, it is theorized to become a super dense black dwarf, giving off negligible energy.

In a frame of reference defined by the stars, the rotational period is approximately 25.6 days at the equator and 33.5 days at the poles. Viewed from Earth as it orbits the Sun, the <i>apparent rotational period</i> of the Sun at its equator is about 28 days.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Phillips1995-78_49-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>46<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> Viewed from a vantage point above its north pole, the Sun rotates counterclockwise around its axis of spin.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-rotation_50-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>d<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-spaceacademy_51-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>47<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>

<p>The Sun consists mainly of the elements hydrogen and helium. At this time in the Sun's life, they account for 74.9% and 23.8%, respectively, of the mass of the Sun in the photosphere.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-lodders_56-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>52<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> All heavier elements, called <i>metals</i> in astronomy, account for less than 2% of the mass, with oxygen (roughly 1% of the Sun's mass), carbon (0.3%), neon (0.2%), and iron (0.2%) being the most abundant.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-hkt2004_57-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>53<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>The Sun's original chemical composition was inherited from the interstellar medium out of which it formed. Originally it would have been about 71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-lodders_56-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>52<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> The hydrogen and most of the helium in the Sun would have been produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis in the first 20 minutes of the universe, and the heavier elements were produced by previous generations of stars before the Sun was formed, and spread into the interstellar medium during the final stages of stellar life and by events such as supernovae.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-hkt2004_78_58-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>54<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>Since the Sun formed, the main fusion process has involved fusing hydrogen into helium. Over the past 4.6 billion years, the amount of helium and its location within the Sun has gradually changed. The proportion of helium within the core has increased from about 24% to about 60% due to fusion, and some of the helium and heavy elements have settled from the photosphere toward the center of the Sun because of gravity. The proportions of heavier elements are unchanged. Heat is transferred outward from the Sun's core by radiation rather than by convection (see Radiative zone below), so the fusion products are not lifted outward by heat; they remain in the core,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-hkt2004_9.2.3_59-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>55<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> and gradually an inner core of helium has begun to form that cannot be fused because presently the Sun's core is not hot or dense enough to fuse helium. In the current photosphere, the helium fraction is reduced, and the metallicity is only 84% of what it was in the protostellar phase (before nuclear fusion in the core started). In the future, helium will continue to accumulate in the core, and in about 5 billion years this gradual build-up will eventually cause the Sun to exit the main sequence and become a red giant.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-60"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>56<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>The chemical composition of the photosphere is normally considered representative of the composition of the primordial Solar System.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-aller1968_61-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>57<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> Typically, the solar heavy-element abundances described above are measured both by using spectroscopy of the Sun's photosphere and by measuring abundances in meteorites that have never been heated to melting temperatures. These meteorites are thought to retain the composition of the protostellar Sun and are thus not affected by the settling of heavy elements. The two methods generally agree well.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-basu2008_62-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>58<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>

<p>The Sun's convection zone extends from 0.7 solar radii (500,000 km) to near the surface. In this layer, the solar plasma is not dense or hot enough to transfer the heat energy of the interior outward via radiation. Instead, the density of the plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the Sun's energy outward towards its surface. Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise. As a result, an orderly motion of the mass develops into thermal cells that carry most of the heat outward to the Sun's photosphere above. Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks to the base of the convection zone, where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective cycle continues. At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped 350-fold to 5,700 K (9,800 °F) and the density to only 0.2 g/m<sup>3</sup> (about 1/10,000 the density of air at sea level, and 1 millionth that of the inner layer of the convective zone).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-NASA1_65-5"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>61<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>The thermal columns of the convection zone form an imprint on the surface of the Sun giving it a granular appearance called the solar granulation at the smallest scale and supergranulation at larger scales.

</p><p>High-energy gamma ray photons initially released with fusion reactions in the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few millimeters. Re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at slightly lower energy. With this sequence of emissions and absorptions, it takes a long time for radiation to reach the Sun's surface.

<p>The Sun has a stellar magnetic field that varies across its surface.

<p>Sunspots are visible as dark patches on the Sun's photosphere and correspond to concentrations of magnetic field where convective transport of heat is inhibited from the solar interior to the surface. As a result, sunspots are slightly cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so they appear dark. At a typical solar minimum, few sunspots are visible, and occasionally none can be seen at all. Those that do appear are at high solar latitudes. As the solar cycle progresses toward its maximum, sunspots tend to form closer to the solar equator, a phenomenon known as <i>Spörer's law</i>. The largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Sunspot2001_115-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>110<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>An 11-year sunspot cycle is half of a 22-year Babcock–Leighton dynamo cycle, which corresponds to an oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic fields. At solar-cycle maximum, the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength; but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field, generated through differential rotation within the tachocline, is near its maximum strength. At this point in the dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of the toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east–west and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities. The magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon described by Hale's law.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-116"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>111<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-solarcycle_117-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>112<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>During the solar cycle's declining phase, energy shifts from the internal toroidal magnetic field to the external poloidal field, and sunspots diminish in number and size. At solar-cycle minimum, the toroidal field is, correspondingly, at minimum strength, sunspots are relatively rare, and the poloidal field is at its maximum strength. With the rise of the next 11-year sunspot cycle, differential rotation shifts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field, but with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle. The process carries on continuously, and in an idealized, simplified scenario, each 11-year sunspot cycle corresponds to a change, then, in the overall polarity of the Sun's large-scale magnetic field.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-118"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>113<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-119"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>114<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>

<p>The Sun's magnetic field leads to many effects that are collectively called solar activity. Solar flares and coronal mass ejections tend to occur at sunspot groups. Slowly changing high-speed streams of solar wind are emitted from coronal holes at the photospheric surface.

<p>The Sun is about halfway through its main-sequence stage, during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium. Each second, more than four billion kilograms of matter are converted into energy within the Sun's core, producing neutrinos and solar radiation. At this rate, the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy, about 0.03% of the total mass of the Sun. The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 to 11 billion years as a main-sequence star before the red giant phase of the Sun.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-139"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>134<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> At the 8 billion year mark, the Sun will be at its hottest point according to the ESA's <i>Gaia</i> space observatory mission in 2022.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-140"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>135<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>The Sun is gradually becoming hotter in its core, hotter at the surface, larger in radius, and more luminous during its time on the main sequence: since the beginning of its main sequence life, it has expanded in radius by 15% and the surface has increased in temperature from 5,620 K (9,660 °F) to 5,772 K (9,930 °F), resulting in a 48% increase in luminosity from 0.677 solar luminosities to its present-day 1.0 solar luminosity. This occurs because the helium atoms in the core have a higher mean molecular weight than the hydrogen atoms that were fused, resulting in less thermal pressure. The core is therefore shrinking, allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the center, releasing gravitational potential energy. According to the virial theorem, half of this released gravitational energy goes into heating, which leads to a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs and thus an increase in the luminosity. This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-carroll_ostlie_141-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>136<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> At present, it is increasing in brightness by about 1% every 100 million years.

<p>The Sun does not have enough mass to explode as a supernova. Instead, when it runs out of hydrogen in the core in approximately 5 billion years, core hydrogen fusion will stop, and there will be nothing to prevent the core from contracting. The release of gravitational potential energy will cause the luminosity of the Sun to increase, ending the main sequence phase and leading the Sun to expand over the next billion years: first into a subgiant, and then into a red giant.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-carroll_ostlie_141-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>136<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-144"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>139<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-schroder_145-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>140<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> The heating due to gravitational contraction will also lead to expansion of the Sun and hydrogen fusion in a shell just outside the core, where unfused hydrogen remains, contributing to the increased luminosity, which will eventually reach more than 1,000 times its present luminosity.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-carroll_ostlie_141-2"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>136<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> When the Sun enters its red-giant branch (RGB) phase, it will engulf (and very likely destroy) Mercury and Venus. According to a 2008 paper, Earth's orbit will have initially expanded to at most 1.5 AU (220 million km; 140 million mi) due to the Sun's loss of mass. However, Earth's orbit will then start shrinking due to tidal forces (and, eventually, drag from the lower chromosphere) so that it is engulfed by the Sun during the tip of the red-giant branch phase 7.59 billion years from now, 3.8 and 1 million years after Mercury and Venus have respectively suffered the same fate.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-schroder_145-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>140<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>By the time the Sun reaches the tip of the red-giant branch, it will be about 256 times larger than it is today, with a radius of 1.19 AU (178 million km; 111 million mi).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-schroder_145-2"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>140<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-sackmann_146-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>141<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> The Sun will spend around a billion years in the RGB and lose around a third of its mass.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-schroder_145-3"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>140<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>After the red-giant branch, the Sun has approximately 120 million years of active life left, but much happens. First, the core (full of degenerate helium) ignites violently in the helium flash; it is estimated that 6% of the core—itself 40% of the Sun's mass—will be converted into carbon within a matter of minutes through the triple-alpha process.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-147"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>142<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> The Sun then shrinks to around 10 times its current size and 50 times the luminosity, with a temperature a little lower than today. It will then have reached the red clump or horizontal branch, but a star of the Sun's metallicity does not evolve blueward along the horizontal branch. Instead, it just becomes moderately larger and more luminous over about 100 million years as it continues to react helium in the core.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-schroder_145-4"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>140<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>When the helium is exhausted, the Sun will repeat the expansion it followed when the hydrogen in the core was exhausted. This time, however, it all happens faster, and the Sun becomes larger and more luminous. This is the asymptotic-giant-branch phase, and the Sun is alternately reacting hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell. After about 20 million years on the early asymptotic giant branch, the Sun becomes increasingly unstable, with rapid mass loss and thermal pulses that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so. The thermal pulses become larger each time, with the later pulses pushing the luminosity to as much as 5,000 times the current level. Despite this, the Sun's maximum AGB radius will not be as large as its tip-RGB maximum: 179 <var>R</var><sub>☉</sub>, or about 0.832 AU (124.5 million km; 77.3 million mi).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-schroder_145-5"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>140<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-agb_148-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>143<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>Models vary depending on the rate and timing of mass loss. Models that have higher mass loss on the red-giant branch produce smaller, less luminous stars at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch, perhaps only 2,000 times the luminosity and less than 200 times the radius.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-schroder_145-6"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>140<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> For the Sun, four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer envelope and starts to make a planetary nebula.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-SunIII_149-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>144<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>The post-asymptotic-giant-branch evolution is even faster. The luminosity stays approximately constant as the temperature increases, with the ejected half of the Sun's mass becoming ionized into a planetary nebula as the exposed core reaches 30,000 K (53,500 °F), as if it is in a sort of blue loop. The final naked core, a white dwarf, will have a temperature of over 100,000 K (180,000 °F) and contain an estimated 54.05% of the Sun's present-day mass.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-schroder_145-7"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>140<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> (Simulations indicate that the Sun may be among the least massive stars capable of forming a planetary nebula.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-150"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>145<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>) The planetary nebula will disperse in about 10,000 years, but the white dwarf will survive for trillions of years before fading to a hypothetical super-dense black dwarf.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-bloecker1_151-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>146<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-bloecker2_152-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>147<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-153"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>148<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> As such, it would give off no more energy.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Johnson-Groh_2020_j255_154-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>149<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>

Some improvised filters that pass UV or IR rays, can actually harm the eye at high brightness levels.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-222"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>217<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> Brief glances at the midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Macdonald_223-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>218<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>During sunrise and sunset, sunlight is attenuated because of Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering from a particularly long passage through Earth's atmosphere,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Haber2005_224-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>219<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> and the Sun is sometimes faint enough to be viewed comfortably with the naked eye or safely with optics (provided there is no risk of bright sunlight suddenly appearing through a break between clouds). Hazy conditions, atmospheric dust, and high humidity contribute to this atmospheric attenuation.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-225"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>220<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>

<p>An optical phenomenon, known as a green flash, can sometimes be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is scattered more, leaving light that is perceived as green.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-226"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>221<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>

<p>Solar deities play a major role in many world religions and mythologies.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-APLLondon_227-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>222<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> Worship of the Sun was central to civilizations such as the ancient Egyptians, the Inca of South America and the Aztecs of what is now Mexico. In religions such as Hinduism, the Sun is still considered a god, known as Surya. Many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind; for example, stone megaliths accurately mark the summer or winter solstice (for example in Nabta Playa, Egypt; Mnajdra, Malta; and Stonehenge, England); Newgrange, a prehistoric human-built mount in Ireland, was designed to detect the winter solstice; the pyramid of El Castillo at Chichén Itzá in Mexico is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the pyramid at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-228"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>223<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>

<p>From at least the Fourth Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, the Sun was worshipped as the god Ra, portrayed as a falcon-headed divinity surmounted by the solar disk, and surrounded by a serpent. In the New Empire period, the Sun became identified with the dung beetle. In the form of the sun disc Aten, the Sun had a brief resurgence during the Amarna Period when it again became the preeminent, if not only, divinity for the Pharaoh Akhenaton.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-231"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>226<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-232"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>227<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> The Egyptians portrayed the god Ra as being carried across the sky in a solar barque, accompanied by lesser gods, and to the Greeks, he was Helios, carried by a chariot drawn by fiery horses. From the reign of Elagabalus in the late Roman Empire the Sun's birthday was a holiday celebrated as Sol Invictus (literally "Unconquered Sun") soon after the winter solstice, which may have been an antecedent to Christmas. Regarding the fixed stars, the Sun appears from Earth to revolve once a year along the ecliptic through the zodiac, and so Greek astronomers categorized it as one of the seven planets (Greek <i>planetes</i>, "wanderer"); the naming of the days of the weeks after the seven planets dates to the Roman era.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-oed_233-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>228<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-almagest_234-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>229<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-235"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>230<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>

In paganism, the Sun was a source of life, giving warmth and illumination. It was the center of a popular cult among Romans, who would stand at dawn to catch the first rays of sunshine as they prayed. The celebration of the winter solstice (which influenced Christmas) was part of the Roman cult of the unconquered Sun (Sol Invictus). It was adopted as the Sabbath day by Christians. The symbol of light was a pagan device adopted by Christians, and perhaps the most important one that did not come from Jewish traditions.
