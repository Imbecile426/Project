<p>The <b>Moon</b> is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), about 30 times the diameter of Earth. Tidal forces between Earth and the Moon have synchronized the Moon's orbital period (lunar month) with its rotation period (lunar day) at 29.5 Earth days, causing the same side of the Moon to always face Earth. The Moon's gravitational pull—and, to a lesser extent, the Sun's—are the main drivers of Earth's tides.
</p><p>In geophysical terms, the Moon is a planetary-mass object or satellite planet. Its mass is 1.2% that of the Earth, and its diameter is 3,474 km (2,159 mi), roughly one-quarter of Earth's (about as wide as the United States from coast to coast). Within the Solar System, it is the largest and most massive satellite in relation to its parent planet, the fifth largest and most massive moon overall, and larger and more massive than all known dwarf planets.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Metzger2021_22-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>17<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earth's, about half of that of Mars, and the second highest among all Solar System moons, after Jupiter's moon Io. The body of the Moon is differentiated and terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere, atmosphere, or magnetic field. It formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia.
</p><p>The lunar surface is covered in lunar dust and marked by mountains, impact craters, their ejecta, ray-like streaks, rilles and, mostly on the near side of the Moon, by dark maria ("seas"), which are plains of cooled magma. These maria were formed when molten lava flowed into ancient impact basins. The Moon is, except when passing through Earth's shadow during a lunar eclipse, always illuminated by the Sun, but from Earth the visible illumination shifts during its orbit, producing the lunar phases.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-23"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>18<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> The Moon is the brightest celestial object in Earth's night sky. This is mainly due to its large angular diameter, while the reflectance of the lunar surface is comparable to that of asphalt. The apparent size is nearly the same as that of the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun completely during a total solar eclipse. From Earth about 59% of the lunar surface is visible over time due to cyclical shifts in perspective (libration), making parts of the far side of the Moon visible.
</p><p>The Moon has been an important source of inspiration and knowledge for humans, having been crucial to cosmography, mythology, religion, art, time keeping, natural science, and spaceflight. In 1959, the first human-made objects to leave Earth and reach another body arrived at the Moon, with the flyby of the Soviet Union's Luna 1 and the intentional impact of Luna 2. In 1966, the Moon became the first extraterrestrial body with a soft landing by Luna 9 and a orbital insertion by Luna 10 were achieved. On July 20, 1969, humans for the first time landed on the Moon and any extraterrestrial body, at Mare Tranquillitatis with the lander <i>Eagle</i> of the United States' Apollo 11 mission. Five more crews were sent between then and 1972, each with two men landing on the surface. The longest stay was 75 hours by the Apollo 17 crew. Since then, exploration of the Moon has continued robotically, and crewed missions are being planned to return beginning in the late 2020s.

<p>The main features visible from Earth by the naked eye are dark and relatively featureless lunar plains called <i>maria</i> (singular <i>mare</i>; Latin for "seas", as they were once believed to be filled with water)<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-131"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>124<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> are vast solidified pools of ancient basaltic lava. Although similar to terrestrial basalts, lunar basalts have more iron and no minerals altered by water.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-132"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>125<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> The majority of these lava deposits erupted or flowed into the depressions associated with impact basins, though the Moon's largest expanse of basalt flooding, Oceanus Procellarum, does not correspond to an obvious impact basin. Different episodes of lava flows in maria can often be recognized by variations in surface albedo and distinct flow margins.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-133"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>126<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>As the maria formed, cooling and contraction of the basaltic lava created wrinkle ridges in some areas. These low, sinuous ridges can extend for hundreds of kilometers and often outline buried structures within the mare. Another result of maria formation is the creation of concentric depressions along the edges, known as arcuate rilles. These features occur as the mare basalts sink inward under their own weight, causing the edges to fracture and separate.
</p><p>In addition to the visible maria, the Moon has mare deposits covered by ejecta from impacts. Called cryptomares, these hidden mares are likely older than the exposed ones.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-134"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>127<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> Conversely, mare lava has obscured many impact melt sheets and pools. Impact melts are formed when intense shock pressures from collisions vaporize and melt zones around the impact site. Where still exposed, impact melt can be distinguished from mare lava by its distribution, albedo, and texture.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-135"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>128<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>Sinuous rilles, found in and around maria, are likely extinct lava channels or collapsed lava tubes. They typically originate from volcanic vents, meandering and sometimes branching as they progress. The largest examples, such as Schroter's Valley and Rima Hadley, are significantly longer, wider, and deeper than terrestrial lava channels, sometimes featuring bends and sharp turns that again, are uncommon on Earth.
</p><p>Mare volcanism has altered impact craters in various ways, including filling them to varying degrees, and raising and fracturing their floors from uplift of mare material beneath their interiors. Examples of such craters include Taruntius and Gassendi. Some craters, such as Hyginus, are of wholly volcanic origin, forming as calderas or collapse pits. Such craters are relatively rare, and tend to be smaller (typically a few kilometers wide), shallower, and more irregularly shaped than impact craters. They also lack the upturned rims characteristic of impact craters.
</p><p>Several geologic provinces containing shield volcanoes and volcanic domes are found within the near side maria.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-136"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>129<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> There are also some regions of pyroclastic deposits, scoria cones and non-basaltic domes made of particularly high viscosity lava.

<p>A major geologic process that has affected the Moon's surface is impact cratering,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-153"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>146<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> with craters formed when asteroids and comets collide with the lunar surface. There are estimated to be roughly 300,000 craters wider than 1 km (0.6 mi) on the Moon's near side.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-154"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>147<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> Lunar craters exhibit a variety of forms, depending on their size. In order of increasing diameter, the basic types are simple craters with smooth bowl shaped interiors and upturned rims, complex craters with flat floors, terraced walls and central peaks, peak ring basins, and multi-ring basins with two or more concentric rings of peaks.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-155"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>148<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> The vast majority of impact craters are circular, but some, like Cantor and Janssen, have more polygonal outlines, possibly guided by underlying faults and joints. Others, such as the Messier pair, Schiller, and Daniell, are elongated. Such elongation can result from highly oblique impacts, binary asteroid impacts, fragmentation of impactors before surface strike, or closely spaced secondary impacts.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-156"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>149<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>The lunar geologic timescale is based on the most prominent impact events, such as multi-ring formations like Nectaris, Imbrium, and Orientale that are between hundreds and thousands of kilometers in diameter and associated with a broad apron of ejecta deposits that form a regional stratigraphic horizon.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-geologic_157-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>150<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> The lack of an atmosphere, weather, and recent geological processes mean that many of these craters are well-preserved. Although only a few multi-ring basins have been definitively dated, they are useful for assigning relative ages. Because impact craters accumulate at a nearly constant rate, counting the number of craters per unit area can be used to estimate the age of the surface.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-geologic_157-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>150<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
However care needs to be exercised with the crater counting technique due to the potential presence of secondary craters. Ejecta from impacts can create secondary craters that often appear in clusters or chains, but can also occur as isolated formations at a considerable distance from the impact. These can resemble primary craters, and may even dominate small crater populations, so their unidentified presence can distort age estimates.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-158"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>151<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>The radiometric ages of impact-melted rocks collected during the Apollo missions cluster between 3.8 and 4.1 billion years old: this has been used to propose a Late Heavy Bombardment period of increased impacts.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-159"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>152<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>High-resolution images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in the 2010s show a contemporary crater-production rate significantly higher than was previously estimated.

<p>Lunar swirls are enigmatic features found across the Moon's surface. They are characterized by a high albedo, appear optically immature (i.e. the optical characteristics of a relatively young regolith), and often have a sinuous shape. Their shape is often accentuated by low albedo regions that wind between the bright swirls. They are located in places with enhanced surface magnetic fields and many are located at the antipodal point of major impacts. Well known swirls include the Reiner Gamma feature and Mare Ingenii. They are hypothesized to be areas that have been partially shielded from the solar wind, resulting in slower space weathering.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-163"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>156<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>

<p>The Earth and the Moon form the Earth-Moon satellite system with a shared center of mass, or barycenter. This barycenter is 1,700 km (1,100 mi) (about a quarter of Earth's radius) beneath the Earth's surface.

The semi-major axis of the geocentric lunar orbit, called the lunar distance, is approximately 400,000 km (250,000 miles or 1.28 light-seconds), comparable to going around Earth 9.5 times.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-The_Aerospace_Corporation_2023_j509_184-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>177<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>

</p><p>Due to tidal locking, the Moon has a 1:1 spin–orbit resonance. This rotation–orbit ratio makes the Moon's orbital periods around Earth equal to its corresponding rotation periods. This is the reason for only one side of the Moon, its so-called near side, being visible from Earth. That said, while the movement of the Moon is in resonance, it still is not without nuances such as libration, resulting in slightly changing perspectives, making over time and location on Earth about 59% of the Moon's surface visible from Earth.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Liberation_188-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>179<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>

<p>The gravitational attraction that Earth and the Moon (as well as the Sun) exert on each other manifests in a slightly greater attraction on the sides closest to each other, resulting in tidal forces. Ocean tides are the most widely experienced result of this, but tidal forces also considerably affect other mechanics of Earth, as well as the Moon and their system.
</p><p>The lunar solid crust experiences tides of around 10 cm (4 in) amplitude over 27 days, with three components: a fixed one due to Earth, because they are in synchronous rotation, a variable tide due to orbital eccentricity and inclination, and a small varying component from the Sun.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-touma1994_191-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>182<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> The Earth-induced variable component arises from changing distance and libration, a result of the Moon's orbital eccentricity and inclination (if the Moon's orbit were perfectly circular and un-inclined, there would only be solar tides).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-touma1994_191-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>182<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> According to recent research, scientists suggest that the Moon's influence on the Earth may contribute to maintaining Earth's magnetic field.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-192"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>183<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>The cumulative effects of stress built up by these tidal forces produces moonquakes. Moonquakes are much less common and weaker than are earthquakes, although moonquakes can last for up to an hour – significantly longer than terrestrial quakes – because of scattering of the seismic vibrations in the dry fragmented upper crust. The existence of moonquakes was an unexpected discovery from seismometers placed on the Moon by Apollo astronauts from 1969 through 1972.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-193"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>184<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>The most commonly known effect of tidal forces are elevated sea levels called ocean tides.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Lambeck1977_194-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>185<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> While the Moon exerts most of the tidal forces, the Sun also exerts tidal forces and therefore contributes to the tides as much as 40% of the Moon's tidal force; producing in interplay the spring and neap tides.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Lambeck1977_194-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>185<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>The tides are two bulges in the Earth's oceans, one on the side facing the Moon and the other on the side opposite. As the Earth rotates on its axis, one of the ocean bulges (high tide) is held in place "under" the Moon, while another such tide is opposite. As a result, there are two high tides, and two low tides in about 24 hours.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Lambeck1977_194-2"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>185<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> Since the Moon is orbiting the Earth in the same direction of the Earth's rotation, the high tides occur about every 12 hours and 25 minutes; the 25 minutes is due to the Moon's time to orbit the Earth.
</p><p>If the Earth were a water world (one with no continents) it would produce a tide of only one meter, and that tide would be very predictable, but the ocean tides are greatly modified by other effects:
</p>
<ul><li>the frictional coupling of water to Earth's rotation through the ocean floors</li>
<li>the inertia of water's movement</li>
<li>ocean basins that grow shallower near land</li>
<li>the sloshing of water between different ocean basins<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-195"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>186<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup></li></ul>
<p>As a result, the timing of the tides at most points on the Earth is a product of observations that are explained, incidentally, by theory.
</p>
<div class="mw-heading mw-heading4"><h4 id="System_evolution">System evolution</h4></div>
<p>Delays in the tidal peaks of both ocean and solid-body tides cause torque in opposition to the Earth's rotation. This "drains" angular momentum and rotational kinetic energy from Earth's rotation, slowing the Earth's rotation.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Lambeck1977_194-3"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>185<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-touma1994_191-2"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>182<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> That angular momentum, lost from the Earth, is transferred to the Moon in a process known as tidal acceleration, which lifts the Moon into a higher orbit while lowering orbital speed around the Earth.
</p><p>Thus the distance between Earth and Moon is increasing, and the Earth's rotation is slowing in reaction.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-touma1994_191-3"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>182<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> Measurements from laser reflectors left during the Apollo missions (lunar ranging experiments) have found that the Moon's distance increases by 38 mm (1.5 in) per year (roughly the rate at which human fingernails grow).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-196"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>187<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-197"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>188<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-198"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>189<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>

</p><p>This tidal drag makes the rotation of the Earth and the orbital period of the Moon very slowly match. This matching first results in tidally locking the lighter body of the orbital system, as is already the case with the Moon. Theoretically, in 50 billion years,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Universe_Today_2016_202-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>193<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> the Earth's rotation will have slowed to the point of matching the Moon's orbital period, causing the Earth to always present the same side to the Moon.

</p><p>If the Earth-Moon system isn't engulfed by the enlarged Sun, the drag from the solar atmosphere can cause the orbit of the Moon to decay. Once the orbit of the Moon closes to a distance of 18,470 km (11,480 mi), it will cross Earth's Roche limit, meaning that tidal interaction with Earth would break apart the Moon, turning it into a ring system. Most of the orbiting rings will begin to decay, and the debris will impact Earth. Hence, even if the Sun does not swallow up Earth, the planet may be left moonless.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-space070122_205-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>196<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>

</p><p>At the North and South Poles the Moon is 24 hours above the horizon for two weeks every tropical month (about 27.3 days), comparable to the polar day of the tropical year.

<p>The tidally locked synchronous rotation of the Moon as it orbits the Earth results in it always keeping nearly the same face turned towards the planet. The side of the Moon that faces Earth is called the near side, and the opposite the far side. The far side is often inaccurately called the "dark side", but it is in fact illuminated as often as the near side: once every 29.5 Earth days.

<p>Half of the Moon's surface is always illuminated by the Sun (except during a lunar eclipse). Earth also reflects light onto the Moon, observable at times as Earthlight when it is reflected back to Earth from areas of the near side of the Moon that are not illuminated by the Sun.
</p><p>Since the Moon's axial tilt with respect to the ecliptic is 1.5427°, in every draconic year (346.62 days) the Sun moves from being 1.5427° north of the lunar equator to being 1.5427° south of it and then back, just as on Earth the Sun moves from the Tropic of Cancer to the Tropic of Capricorn and back once every tropical year. The poles of the Moon are therefore in the dark for half a draconic year (or with only part of the Sun visible) and then lit for half a draconic year. The amount of sunlight falling on horizontal areas near the poles depends on the altitude angle of the Sun. But these "seasons" have little effect in more equatorial areas.
</p><p>With the different positions of the Moon, different areas of it are illuminated by the Sun.

<p>There has been historical controversy over whether observed features on the Moon's surface change over time. Today, many of these claims are thought to be illusory, resulting from observation under different lighting conditions, poor astronomical seeing, or inadequate drawings. However, outgassing does occasionally occur and could be responsible for a minor percentage of the reported lunar transient phenomena. Recently, it has been suggested that a roughly 3 km (1.9 mi) diameter region of the lunar surface was modified by a gas release event about a million years ago.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-217"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>208<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-218"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>209<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>

<p>The Moon has an exceptionally low albedo, giving it a reflectance that is slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt.

The edges of the full moon seem as bright as the center, without limb darkening, because of the reflective properties of lunar soil, which retroreflects light more towards the Sun than in other directions. The Moon's color depends on the light the Moon reflects, which in turn depends on the Moon's surface and its features, having for example large darker regions. In general the lunar surface reflects a brown-tinged gray light.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Science_Mission_Directorate_2020_221-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>211<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>At times, the Moon can appear red or blue.
It may appear red during a lunar eclipse, because of the red spectrum of the Sun's light being refracted onto the Moon by Earth's atmosphere. Because of this red color, lunar eclipses are also sometimes called blood moons. The Moon can also seem red when it appears at low angles and through a thick atmosphere.
</p><p>The Moon may appear blue depending on the presence of certain particles in the air,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Science_Mission_Directorate_2020_221-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>211<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> such as volcanic particles,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-222"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>212<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> in which case it can be called a blue moon.
</p><p>Because the words "red moon" and "blue moon" can also be used to refer to specific full moons of the year, they do not always refer to the presence of red or blue moonlight.

<p>Eclipses only occur when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are all in a straight line (termed "syzygy"). Solar eclipses occur at new moon, when the Moon is between the Sun and Earth. In contrast, lunar eclipses occur at full moon, when Earth is between the Sun and Moon. The apparent size of the Moon is roughly the same as that of the Sun, with both being viewed at close to one-half a degree wide. The Sun is much larger than the Moon but it is the vastly greater distance that gives it the same apparent size as the much closer and much smaller Moon from the perspective of Earth. The variations in apparent size, due to the non-circular orbits, are nearly the same as well, though occurring in different cycles. This makes possible both total (with the Moon appearing larger than the Sun) and annular (with the Moon appearing smaller than the Sun) solar eclipses.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-223"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>213<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> In a total eclipse, the Moon completely covers the disc of the Sun and the solar corona becomes visible to the naked eye.
</p><p>Because the distance between the Moon and Earth is very slowly increasing over time,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Lambeck1977_194-4"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>185<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> the angular diameter of the Moon is decreasing. As it evolves toward becoming a red giant, the size of the Sun, and its apparent diameter in the sky, are slowly increasing.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-size_changes_224-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>k<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> The combination of these two changes means that hundreds of millions of years ago, the Moon would always completely cover the Sun on solar eclipses, and no annular eclipses were possible. Likewise, hundreds of millions of years in the future, the Moon will no longer cover the Sun completely, and total solar eclipses will not occur.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-fourmilab_225-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>214<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>As the Moon's orbit around Earth is inclined by about 5.145° (5° 9') to the orbit of Earth around the Sun, eclipses do not occur at every full and new moon. For an eclipse to occur, the Moon must be near the intersection of the two orbital planes.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-eclipse_226-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>215<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> The periodicity and recurrence of eclipses of the Sun by the Moon, and of the Moon by Earth, is described by the saros, which has a period of approximately 18 years.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-227"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>216<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>Because the Moon continuously blocks the view of a half-degree-wide circular area of the sky,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-area_228-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>l<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-229"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>217<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> the related phenomenon of occultation occurs when a bright star or planet passes behind the Moon and is occulted: hidden from view. In this way, a solar eclipse is an occultation of the Sun. Because the Moon is comparatively close to Earth, occultations of individual stars are not visible everywhere on the planet, nor at the same time. Because of the precession of the lunar orbit, each year different stars are occulted.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-230"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>218<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>

<p>Following President John F. Kennedy's 1961 commitment to a crewed Moon landing before the end of the decade, the United States, under NASA leadership, launched a series of uncrewed probes to develop an understanding of the lunar surface in preparation for human missions: the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Ranger program, the Lunar Orbiter program and the Surveyor program. The crewed Apollo program was developed in parallel; after a series of uncrewed and crewed tests of the Apollo spacecraft in Earth orbit, and spurred on by a potential Soviet lunar human landing, in 1968 Apollo 8 made the first human mission to lunar orbit (the first Earthlings, two tortoises, had circled the Moon three months earlier on the Soviet Union's Zond 5, followed by turtles on Zond 6).

Such shapes are among others the Man in the Moon (e.g. Coyolxāuhqui) or the Moon Rabbit (e.g. the Chinese Tu'er Ye or in Indigenous American mythologies the aspect of the Mayan Moon goddess, from which possibly Awilix is derived, or of Metztli/Tēcciztēcatl).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Collections_Search_–_Museum_of_Fine_Arts,_Boston_1987_344-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>332<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
</p><p>Occasionally some lunar deities have been also depicted driving a chariot across the sky, such as the Hindu Chandra/Soma, the Greek Artemis, which is associated with Selene, or Luna, Selene's ancient Roman equivalent.

<p>The perception of the Moon in modern times has been informed by telescope enabled modern astronomy and later by spaceflight enabled actual human activity at the Moon, particularly the culturally impactful lunar landings.

<p>The lunar effect is a purported unproven correlation between specific stages of the roughly 29.5-day lunar cycle and behavior and physiological changes in living beings on Earth, including humans. The Moon has long been associated with insanity and irrationality; the words <i>lunacy</i> and <i>lunatic</i> are derived from the Latin name for the Moon, <i>Luna</i>. Philosophers Aristotle and Pliny the Elder argued that the full moon induced insanity in susceptible individuals, believing that the brain, which is mostly water, must be affected by the Moon and its power over the tides, but the Moon's gravity is too slight to affect any single person.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-sciam_358-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>346<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup> Even today, people who believe in a lunar effect claim that admissions to psychiatric hospitals, traffic accidents, homicides or suicides increase during a full moon, but dozens of studies invalidate these claims.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-sciam_358-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>346<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-RottonKelly1985_359-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>347<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-MartensKelly1988_360-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>348<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-kelly_361-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>349<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-FosterRoenneberg2008_362-0"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>350<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></sup>
